# Mastermind_game
Word/number guessing game in C++

This is based of the game Mastermind (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Variations) invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. There is a random but secret code of digits (four to six) which must be guessed (strategically) by the player. The player plays one on one against the computer (who creates the secret code) and guesses over and over until he or she guesses correctly or runs out of tries. After each guess, the computer returns clues (an “o” for each correct digit in the correct place and an “x” for each correct digit but in the wrong place). 
The goal of the user is to guess the code correctly.

This implentation supports 3 or 4 letter words and 4 - 6 digit numbers.
